# Example htpasswd file for basic authentication
# Generate your own password with: htpasswd -c .htpasswd username
# Or online at: https://hostingcanada.org/htpasswd-generator/

# Format: username:encrypted_password
# Example user (username: admin, password: changeme):
admin:$apr1$ruca84Hq$m7hN7S2gfkDx4f7z8z0vZ0

# IMPORTANT: 
# 1. Delete this file after creating your own .htpasswd
